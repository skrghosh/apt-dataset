# Caldera APT Simulation Datasets

This repository contains datasets from a series of APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) simulations conducted using [Caldera](https://caldera.mitre.org/), guided by the best practices from MITRE's [Center for Threat-Informed Defense](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/adversary_emulation_library). The simulations represent a variety of attack scenarios, providing a rich resource for understanding the nature of sophisticated cyber threats.

## Dataset Overview

The datasets encompass multiple attack scenarios simulated in a controlled environment. Each scenario's dataset includes comprehensive logs with details of benign and malicious activities, offering invaluable insights for cybersecurity analysis.

These datasets were generated by emulating various attack vectors as outlined by MITRE, primarily involving the CALDERA automation framework, as well as general file execution techniques. They offer an array of records ranging from hundreds of thousands to several million, with the overwhelming majority representing benign activities to provide realistic baseline behavior.

## Dataset Details

- **Total Records:** See the table above for the record count of each campaign.
- **Target System:** Windows 10 (64-bit).
- **Duration of Simulation:** Times vary per simulation campaign as detailed above.
- **Benign Records:** To mimic real-world environments where these attacks are generally executed, we created this dataset to contain a majority of benign daily activities of users with a minuscule amount of malicious activities, as outlined by MITRE. These benign activities include surfing the web by visiting several random websites, downloading different types of files from websites, uploading different files to websites, opening system files, creating different file types, editing (and renaming) and saving those updated files, deleting different files, running several user commands from PowerShell or cmd, running different applications, creating, renaming, deleting several directories, copying files and folders, compressing and decompressing files, etc. More than 99% of the data for each scenario represents benign data, as shown above.
- **Data Model:** The audit logs are modeled based on MITRE's CAR (Cyber Analytics Repository) and FiveDirections' eCAR data model. More details about the data model can be found [here](https://github.com/FiveDirections/OpTC-data/blob/master/ecar.md).

Corresponding ground truths for each scenario are included in the Ground Truth directory to facilitate validation and benchmarking efforts.
