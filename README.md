# Caldera APT Simulation Datasets

This repository contains datasets from a series of APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) simulations conducted using [Caldera](https://caldera.mitre.org/), guided by the best practices from MITRE's [Center for Threat-Informed Defense](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/adversary_emulation_library). The simulations represent a variety of attack scenarios, providing a rich resource for understanding the nature of sophisticated cyber threats.

## Dataset Overview

The datasets encompass multiple attack scenarios simulated in a controlled environment. Each scenario's dataset includes comprehensive logs with details of benign and malicious activities, offering invaluable insights for cybersecurity analysis.

These datasets were generated by emulating various attack vectors as outlined by MITRE, primarily involving the CALDERA automation framework, as well as general file execution techniques. They offer an array of records ranging from hundreds of thousands to several million, with the overwhelming majority representing benign activities to provide realistic baseline behavior.

## Dataset Details

- **Total Records:** See the table above for the record count of each campaign.
- **Target System:** Windows 10 (64-bit).
- **Duration of Simulation:** Times vary per simulation campaign as detailed above.
- **Nature of Records:** Predominantly benign with a specific percentage of attacker activities, as noted in the table.
- **Data Model:** The audit logs are modeled based on MITRE's CAR (Cyber Analytics Repository) and FiveDirections' eCAR data model. [More details](https://github.com/FiveDirections/OpTC-data/blob/master/ecar.md) about the data model.


## Ground Truth

Corresponding ground truths for each scenario are included in the Ground Truth directory to facilitate validation and benchmarking efforts.

## Usage

These datasets are versatile, suited for:
- **Research:** Understand APT behaviors and patterns.
- **Machine Learning:** Train models to differentiate between benign and malicious actions.
- **Benchmarking:** Evaluate the effectiveness of security systems against simulated APT attacks.

**Anonymization Update:**
We are currently in the process of anonymizing the dataset to remove identifiable keywords. This will be completed in the upcoming weeks.
